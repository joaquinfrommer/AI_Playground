Basic Misconfigurations

Telnet:
You may be able to log into telnet with no password if you provide a valid username, try root to start.

FTP:
You may be able to use the username anonymous with no password to log into an ftp server without knowing an account

SMB:
The null session, if not disabled, allows for anonymous/guest access to a network resource when using no credentials.

On UNIX, tools like smbclient (C) and smbmap (Python) can be used to access SMB shares with null sessions. Null credentials do not have to be explicitly set in this case.

# List shares
smbclient --list //$IP
smbmap -H $IP

# List shares (implicit null creds)
smbclient --no-pass --list //$IP

# List shares (explicit null creds)
smbclient --user ''%'' --list //$IP
smbmap -u '' -p '' -H $IP

# Open an interactive session to operate on a specific share
smbclient //$IP/$SHARE_NAME

On Windows, the net cmdlet can be used to natively interact with SMB shares and explicitly set null credentials.
# Use null credentials for SMB share on windows
net use \\$IP\$SHARE_NAME '' /user:''
